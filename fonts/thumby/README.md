# FancyFont

_A MicroPython font library for the Thumby playable keychain console_

FancyFont is a drop-in replacement to the `setFont()` and `drawText()` functions in
the Thumby API. It has a couple of improvements over those functions, supporting:

  * Variable width fonts
  * Proper word wrapping with `drawTextWrapped()`
  * Loading fonts from file or a `bytearray`
  * Clipping (and not just at the edge of the screen)
  * The newline character (`\n`) in strings
  * Rendering to any bytearray buffer, so "should work" with grayscale or
    non-Thumby projects too

(This sub-project is in this repository because I didn't think it really needed
its own repository. And also so it can share font definitions with the CHIP-8
version of the library.)

## Getting the library

You can [download the FancyFony library
here](https://github.com/Timendus/chipcode/raw/main/fonts/thumby/fancyFont.py).
You'll also need one or more font files. You can find an overview with downloads
in the [Available fonts](#available-fonts) section of this manual.

After that, you will have to upload both the fonts and the library to your
Thumby in a place where your program will be able to find them. More about that
below in the chapter [Explanation by example](#explanation-by-example).

### Minified version

Note that there is also a file called
[`fancyFont-minified.py`](https://github.com/Timendus/chipcode/raw/main/fonts/thumby/fancyFont-minified.py)
in this repository, which is functionally the same library, but without all the
comments and documentation:

```
   15K  fancyFont.py
  4.1K  fancyFont-minified.py
```

It makes quite a bit of difference, so you may want to ship your project with
the minified version of the library.

## Explanation by example

To render this to the display using FancyFont:

![The visual result of the code example below](./pictures/code-example.png)

And assuming that you have uploaded the FancyFont library and the Widewest font
to `/Games/MyGame/`, you need to do something like this:

**`/Games/MyGame/MyGame.py`**
```python
# Fix import path so we can import files in our game directory
from sys import path
path.insert(0, '/Games/MyGame')

# Load either `thumby` or `thumbyGraphics` library
import thumbyGraphics

# Load and initialize `FancyFont` library
from fancyFont import FancyFont
fancyFont = FancyFont(thumbyGraphics.display.display.buffer)

# Clear the screen
thumbyGraphics.display.fill(0)

# Select a TinyCircuits font and draw some text
fancyFont.setFont('font5x7.bin', 5, 7)
fancyFont.drawText('FancyFont\n---------', 9, 4)

# Select a FancyFont font and draw some wrapping text
fancyFont.setFont('5pix-widewest.bin')
fancyFont.drawTextWrapped('Hello there, Thumby user!', 8, 22)

# Show the result
thumbyGraphics.display.update()
```

There are a few interesting differences with the regular Thumby API to note in
the example above:

### `setFont`

`setFont` will actually search the system path if the given string is not an
absolute path. This means you can just call `setFont('font5x7.bin', 5, 7)` and
it will find this file in the `/lib` folder, which is in the default path. After
adding our project's directory to the path (in lines 2 and 3 of the example) we
can also load a font that is stored in our project directory, with
`setFont('5pix-widewest.bin')`.

Something else to notice is that `setFont` can take three more parameters
(character width, character height and gap width) for compatibility with the
Thumby API. But the gap width (or "space") will now default to `1`, which is
usually what it's set to anyway.

When loading variable width fonts in the FancyFont format, you must not give
`setFont` a character width and height. That will tell it that you're loading a
variable width font, and load the dimensions from the file. This is what happens
in the line that says `setFont('5pix-widewest.bin')`.

As an additional bonus feature, fonts can be loaded from a bytearray instead of
a file. This is mostly for power-users who are working on a font in the emulator
or programmatically modifying fonts. If you are one of those users: you can
supply the `setFont` function with a bytearray instead of a path, and it will
Just Work‚Ñ¢Ô∏è for both types of font formats.

### `drawText`

The `drawText` function seems to behave similarly to the Thumby API version at
first, but there are some differences:

  * We can omit the color parameter if we want to draw in white;
  * It will do the right thing if you give it a string with a newline character
    (`\n`) as shown in the example on line 17;
  * It returns the X and Y coordinates where it stopped drawing;
  * It accepts two additional parameters to tell it to clip the string at some
    row and column.

To illustrate the last point, if we change line 17 to this instead:

```python
fancyFont.drawText('FancyFont\n---------', 9, 4, 1, 55, 10)

# or

fancyFont.drawText('FancyFont\n---------', 9, 4, xMax=55, yMax=10)
```

We'll see "FancyFont" being clipped at row 10 and column 55 instead of at the
edge of the screen:

![Example of a fixed width font clipping](./pictures/clipping.png)

### `drawTextWrapped`

`drawTextWrapped` accepts the same inputs as `drawText`, the difference being
that `drawTextwrapped` will treat the clipping column as the point to word-wrap
the string instead.

So if we were to change line 21 to this:

```python
fancyFont.drawTextWrapped('Hello there, Thumby user!', 8, 22, 1, 40, 38)

# or

fancyFont.drawTextWrapped('Hello there, Thumby user!', 8, 22, xMax=40, yMax=38)
```

The string will wrap at column 40 instead of at the edge of the screen, and clip
at row 38 instead of at the bottom of the screen:

![Example of a variable width font word wrapping](./pictures/wrapping.png)

Just like `drawText` it will return the coordinates where the drawing stopped,
which can be very useful for some applications to know how high and how wide the
wrapped result actually is.

### Constructor

Finally, both `drawText` and `drawTextWrapped` draw to the buffer that you
specify in the FancyFont constructor. You must give the constructor a buffer
(generally a bytearray) and optionally a width and a height, which default to 72
and 40. For normal operation this means you just do:

```python
fancyFont = FancyFont(thumbyGraphics.display.display.buffer)

# or

fancyFont = FancyFont(thumby.display.display.buffer)
```

But it gives you some flexibility to draw into another buffer, for example for
use with the grayscale library. It also probably means that this library is not
really a Thumby library, but rather a generic MicroPython library, and could
probably be used for projects on other MicroPython based platforms too.

## Available fonts

The fonts shipped with this library are released under the [Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

This means that when you use these fonts in your own projects, you are required
to give credit to the author and that derivative works may only be distributed
under the same or a compatible license. This way we make sure the body of
publicly available pixel art fonts will only grow over time.

The 3x3 fixed width font called "Auri" was made by Thumby Discord regular Auri,
with feedback from the Thumby community. You may give him credit as such.

The other fonts have been designed and hand-drawn by myself
([Timendus](https://github.com/Timendus/)). Any resemblance to existing
typefaces is either pure coincidence or a result of the limited space of
possibilities at these low resolutions. Please credit me by linking to [this
font library](.), so others may find it and the fonts contained in it.

## Making your own fonts

If you feel like customizing one of the fonts above, or making your own
altogether, you can definitely do so. You will need to download the script
[`convert.py`](./convert.py) and install pillow as a dependency:

```bash
pip3 install pillow
```

Next, you need to create an image like the ones above for your new font. You can
find the source images for the bundled fonts [here](./fonts/images). For the
variable width fonts you will see a little "barcode" above each character. This
is the desired width of that particular character in binary.

Then, to convert your fancy new variable width font image to a `.bin` file, run:

```bash
python3 convert.py <font image> <bin file> <font height>
```

Where 'font height' is the character height in pixels (so without the one
additional pixel for the barcode).

Or to convert a fixed width font image to a `.bin` file, run:

```bash
python3 convert.py <font image> <bin file> <font height> <font width>
```

This should give you a working `.bin` file to use with FancyFont!

Finally: if you have modified one of the existing fonts, please pay attention to
the license of that font, give credit and share alike where necessary.

## API documentation

### Class FancyFont

A container class that holds functions for font rendering for fixed width and
variable width fonts, with optional word-wrapping.

Methods:

  * `__init__`
  * `setFont`
  * `drawText`
  * `drawTextWrapped`

Attributes:

  * None that should be manipulated by the user

#### `__init__(displayBuffer, displayWidth = 72, displayHeight = 40)`

Constructor function to initialize the FancyFont class.

Parameters:

  * `displayBuffer` : `object`
    * The display buffer to draw to. Usually
      thumbyGraphics.display.display.buffer.

  * `displayWidth` : `int`
    * The width of the display to draw to, in pixels. Usually
      thumbyGraphics.display.width. Defaults to 72.

  * `displayHeight` : `int`
    * The height of the display to draw to, in pixels. Usually
      thumbyGraphics.display.height. Defaults to 40.

#### `setFont(fontPath, width:int = None, height:int = None, space:int = 1)`

Set the font file at `fontPath` as the current font to be used for all
subsequent drawText commands.

Parameters:

  * `fontPath` : `string` or `bytearray`
      * If `string`: A path to a file that contains a font in either the
        TinyCircuits fixed width font file format or a FancyFont variable
        width font file. Path may be absolute or relative to any entry in
        `sys.path`.
      * If `bytearray`: A bytearray containing a font in either the
        TinyCircuits fixed width font format or a FancyFont variable width
        format.

  * `width` : `int`
      * The character width of the font, if the font is fixed width. Omit or
        supply `None` for variable width. Note that characters with a width
        of more than 8 pixels are *not supported*.

  * `height` : `int`
      * The character height of the font, if the font is fixed width. Omit
        or supply `None` for variable width font files. The character height
        will then be read from the font file. Note that characters with a
        height of more than 8 pixels are *not supported*.

  * `space` : `int`
      * The margin between characters for fixed width fonts. Defaults to 1.
        Ignored for variable width fonts.

Exceptions:

  * `OSError` 'Font file not found'
    * Will be raised when the given font path could not be resolved to a font
      file as an absolute path or as a path relative to any entry in `sys.path`.

#### `drawText(string, xPos:int, yPos:int, color:int = 1, xMax:int = None, yMax:int = None)`

the given color.

Parameters:

  * `string` : `string`
      * The string to draw to the screen.

  * `xPos` : `int`
      * The X coordinate to start drawing from, counting from the left side
        of the screen.

  * `yPos` : `int`
      * The Y coordinate to start drawing from, counting from the top of the

  * `xMax` : `int`
      * The X coordinate to stop drawing from, counting from the left side
        of the screen. Any text wider than xMax - xPos will be clipped.
        Defaults to the display width supplied to the constructor.

  * `yMax` : `int`
      * The Y coordinate to stop drawing from, counting from the top of the
        screen. Any line of text higher than yMax - yPos will be clipped.
        Defaults to the display height supplied to the constructor.

Return value:

  * `[x, y]` : `bytearray` of `int`s
      * The X and Y coordinate at which the drawing actually stopped, which
        should always be equal to or smaller than (xMax, yMax).

#### `drawTextWrapped(string, xPos:int, yPos:int, color:int = 1, xMax:int = None, yMax:int = None)`

Draw a string within the square defined by (xPos, yPos) and (xMax, yMax), in
the given color with word wrapping.
